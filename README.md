# Java Console Application | Student Data Management
The project involved designing and building a console application to store and display student information, their assignment marks and grades.

A text file containing mock data with student information, including assignment marks and grades, was supplied. Class designs and method names with instructions of what each method needed to do was also supplied. The application needed to read the text file and store the information in memory (RAM) before users could interact with the program. A main menu was required for users to gain access to functionality within the application, including viewing, adding and removing student information and exiting the program. The main menu needed to be displayed after every functionality was carried out by the user.

The project was completed within 1 week for 1 assessment whilst completing the Programming I course at Open Polytechnic NZ as part of the Web Development and Design diploma. The application was built with Java code that is well organised and readable with comments.
